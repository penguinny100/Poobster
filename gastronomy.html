                The standard and humble pebble. The pebble makes up the majority of the Poobster's daily caloric
                intake, and for good reason; aiding in digestion and joint health.

                Cheese is one of the few items of human food the Poobster can consistently get. When he hears the
                crinkle of a plastic bag, he knows it's cheese time.

                Leftover tuna from lunch is also sometimes given to the Poobster as long as its not too spicy. He licks the

                Liver treats are mostly given by <b>Saba</b>. Some would say he is given way too much, but the Poobster
                would disagree.
